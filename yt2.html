    (00:00) hi I'm Anubha and I welcome you to Sanjeev Kapoor Kazan and today is a recipe of banana buns well banana buns sounds like a bread isn't it this is a banana puri and it's made with yogurt and banana so to make banana buns we have to make the dough and to make the dough I have some whole wheat flour here with me in which I'm going to put one banana so if the banana is ripe the puri will come out nice so your I have taken one banana and we just have to crush it up like this in the dough but now like you see this is not
    <br><br>
    (00:42) sufficient for it to form a dough so what do you do you add curd and before that let me show you one thing here I have a car eye in which I have put oil the oil is getting heated up while the oil gets heated up will be done with the dough so after adding banana in this we need to now add in curds apart from that we'll add in some sugar a little bit of salt some ghee a little bit of cumin powder and a pinch of soda by cub so once you put all these ingredients in this again you need to gather it up together and make a nice
<br><br>
    (01:20) dough so here is the dough which is done and it has been resting for some time so what you could do is just take small small portions of this dough and what I have here I have a plastic sheet in which I am going to roll them either you can do it this way or you can just use a rolling pin I will show you both ways so you take this keep it here in the center and just press the edges like this and you see this nice good poori is rolled out in hot oil we will put the Puri and just keep on pressing it and when you press it it puffs so just do
<br><br>
    (02:11) this and flip over since this has banana and sugar these porridge will be darker in color let's make some more chorus now what we will do is we will use a rolling pin so when you roll out these puris do not use any dry flour if in case you need to use anything use a little bit of oil so what you can do is just dip this in oil a bit just a little bit of oil on the board in which you are going to roll this don't make it too thin and here goes in the Puri or the banana buns whichever way so this is a simple recipe of a banana Puri
    <br><br>
    (02:50) actually a poori with a difference you can make this keep it have it on the go so rather you would like to call it a poori on the go simple recipe do try it and let me know how we like it but I hope you enjoyed watching this video as much as I enjoyed making it for you make this poori and enjoy I'm sure you all love our recipes so to stay connected please don't forget to subscribe to our channel Sanjeev Kapoor khazana
