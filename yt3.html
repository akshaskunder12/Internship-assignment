        (00:00) Rolling & Action! Yes! Then what do we have to add? Okay! Then how will I get that taste? Yes! ohh.... Okay! Okay! Okay! Bye Mumma bye! So, I was thinking to make "Aloo Paratha" but "Aloo Paratha" nobody makes like mumma, so I've took mumma's recipe. I almost have all the ingredients.
        <br><br>
        (00:40) Hmm.. So, it's nothing! Actually Aloo Paratha is about 2 things, dough and filling. So we'll do the dough first. So.. wheat flour, salt, now here mumma's cheats a little and I like that cheat actually so I'm endorsing that cheat. Very little gram flour for the crispy texture. Now.. carom seeds There is no paratha which can be made without carom seeds.
        <br><br>
        (01:12) Very little ghee, not much. We don't have to crumble it, just lightly fold it. Okay? And water. The dough has to be soft. Unlike puri or kachori, we don't have make a tight dough. It has to be a soft dough. So, paratha has 2 possible logical names. Firstly.. They say, paratha was invented because "Parat or Atta" (layer & flour) so Parat & Atta made "Paratha".
        <br><br>
        (01:54) Some people say that Paratha's dough is kneaded in "Paraat" (a big plate for dough kneading) so that's why it changed from "Paraate" to "Paratha" You know whatever, whatever the logic might be, the fact still is that.. Whole Indian subcontinent, be that Pakistani's, Afghanistani's, Bangladeshi or Kerala.
        <br><br>
        (02:17) Paratha is still a common thread. The place in Kerala where primarily rice are eaten there also paratha is a classic, classic street food. Again, never overwork the dough. Don't overwork the dough. Just knead it with light hands. Okay! Now what do we do? Yes filling! Okay Potatoes! I used to grate the potatoes always, so trying to remember the side i used to.
        <br><br>
        (02:52) From the thicker side. Now ginger (adrak) Grandmother's (adkar) (reverse name of ginger in hindi) Don't be shy in using green chillies. It helps you in waking up in the morning. Coriander is in Punjabi's blood. Now, the most important thing is that the consistency of the filling
        <br><br>
        (03:56) has to be, has to be similar to the consistency of the dough. If you want fully stuffed paratha's, so this is the most important part. Some people add onions in this. If you want you can add the onions but, immediately use the filling after adding the onions, as it will start leaving moisture and filling will get spoiled and start smelling.
        <br><br>
        (04:20) If you want to keep the paratha or filling for a longer time, then don't add onions. Once, the dough is ready, add very little oil. We have to make "Parothi" (small sized paratha)or "Paratha"? No! No! "Parothi's" are also tasty, that small sized. I don't have patience, so I'll make "Paratha".
        <br><br>
        (04:38) Now, there are 2 ways of making paratha. First method is that make cup like this. Don't be shy to add the filling. Push it down. And.. After that, flatten it like this. Now this, rolling out the dough is my nemesis. I get nervous while doing this. So, you can see this from outside, filling of Aloo Paratha is spread evenly.
        <br><br>
        (05:20) Everywhere! Only if the consistency of the dough is good and the filling is enough then it will be even. Now, we are making Paratha instead of Parathi, so I'll change the pan. There is term in Punjabi "Radna" (cooking on low flame) "Radna" means cooking on low flame. So it important to cook on low flame.
        <br><br>
        (05:46) It is very important. Ready! Wow! Green chilli, potatoes and tomatoes are the 3 ingredients which were very late introduced in India, approx 170 years ago. In a Country where history was recorded 10-12 thousand years ago. In which, they got introduced so late and got established at an early age.
        <br><br>
        (06:14) This miracle happened because before potatoes came, purple yam was used and purple yam sometimes had throat issues or sometimes had harshness or purple yam were supplied in big sizes, so it was difficult to manage. So potatoes became the bite size source of starch and the creaminess of the potatoes were not in purple yam. And.. that creaminess is what lead potato to most of applications today.
        <br><br>
        (06:43) Be that "Aloo Tikki" (Potato Patty), it has a crust outside and creaminess inside. That's the play. Be that Aloo Paratha, it has a crust outside and creaminess inside. That's the play. So the creaminess that the potato gives, is one of the biggest reasons it became so popular and so fast in India.
        
        (07:02) See, now you can see the filling it's evenly spread all over. You know why I feel good, because it is not home style, but it is home style. Will do the home style plating. This butter is very important. Here goes pickle. sprinkle some salt. Black pepper powder. Curd with salt and black pepper powder is compulsory with a paratha.
        (07:31) Let's eat then.. Ready? No! No! you look at the recipe and make yours. And ya please do not forget to share, like, subscribe and press that bell icon next to it. It will just help us stay in touch.
